    <h3>Where I've Lived</h3>
    <p>
      I was born in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, in 1995. My family moved to Puerto
      Rico when I was 2. Then we moved to New York State when I was 4. Stayed
      there until I was 7 and moved to the Netherlands, where I completed
      Elementary school. From there moved back to the US, to Georgia in 2007
      when I was 11. And stayed there for the rest of middle school, high
      school, and completed two bachelors degrees there in Mathematics and
      Aerospace Engineering. During the study in Aerospace Engineering I studied
      abroad 3 times, in Ireland, France and Japan. And this gave me a huge
      interest in travel. From there I moved to Dallas, Texas for the summer, to
      intern at Southwest Airlines. And from there to Boston, Massachuseets, to
      intern at John Hancock, and start my masters at Boston University, in
      Actuarial Science. I loved Boston, but was dissatisfied with both the work
      and university experience there, so I traveled around South East Asia for
      a few months, and was forced to end the trip early due to the Covid
      Pandemic. And from there moved to the Netherlands, in 2020, to do my
      masters at Erasmus University in Econometrics: Quantitative Finance. Where
      I still am now.
